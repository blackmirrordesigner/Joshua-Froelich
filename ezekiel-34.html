                <p>Take that song. <span class="cr-emphasis">What a friend we have in Jesus.</span> Amen, Barbara. That last born penny. Great choice. That's one of my favourite ones because we just sang that one a few weeks back and I was talking about it. And you know, we cannot tell when Christ is going to rule the nations, but he's going to do it someday. All flesh is going to see him return. Revelations say on riding a white horse with the sword sticking out of his mouth, which is the word of God to judge the nations. He only in him alone can rightly divide the word of truth and teach it accurately. We try. We sure do.</p>
                <p>And so if you can open up your Bibles as we now open up his word, open up with me to Ezekiel chapter 34, the whole chapter, verses one through 31. And if there's a Bible in front of you, for those maybe who are new, or if you have a Bible, you guys have a Bible over there? Good. Okay. Yep. If you have your Bibles with you, Will, did you bring your Bible? Yeah. Yes, son, you have your Bible? Good. Please open up to Ezekiel chapter 34, verses one through 31. And the title of my sermon this morning is <span class="cr-emphasis">fat, sheep and lean sheep</span>. Start in verse one, Ezekiel chapter 34. You follow along and read this together. It's a prophecy against the shepherds of Israel.</p>
                <blockquote class="cr-pull-quote">Should not shepherds feed the sheep?</blockquote>
                <div class="bible-verse">
                    <p class="verse-ref">Ezekiel 34:1–31</p>
                    <span class="verse-line">The word of the Lord came to me, son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy and say to them, even to the shepherds, thus says the Lord God, all shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves—should not shepherds feed the sheep?—you eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat ones, but you do not feed the sheep.</span>
                    <span class="verse-line indent">The weak you have not strengthened, the sick you have not healed, the injured you have not bound up, the strayed you have not brought back, the lost you have not sought, and with force and harshness you have ruled them.</span>
                    <span class="verse-line indent">So they were scattered because there was no shepherd and they became food for all the wild beasts.</span>
                    <span class="verse-line">My sheep were scattered. They wandered over all the mountains on every high hill. My sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth with none to search or seek for them.</span>
                    <span class="verse-line indent">Therefore you shepherds hear the word of the Lord. As I live, declares the Lord God, surely because my sheep have become a prey and my sheep have become food for all the wild beasts, since there was no shepherd, because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the shepherds have fed themselves and have not fed my sheep.</span>
                    <span class="verse-line indent">Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require my sheep at their hand and put a stop to their feeding the sheep. No longer shall the shepherds feed themselves; I will rescue my sheep from their mouths, that they may not be food for them.</span>
                    <span class="verse-line indent">For thus says the Lord God: behold, I myself will search for my sheep, and I will seek them out as a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his sheep that have been scattered. So will I seek out my sheep, and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.</span>
                    <span class="verse-line indent">And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land, and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel by the ravines and all the inhabited places of the country. I will feed them with good pasture, and on the mountain heights of Israel shall be their grazing land.</span>
                    <span class="verse-line indent">There they shall lie down in good grazing land, and on rich pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel. <strong>I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep</strong>, and I myself will make them lie down, declares the Lord God. I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will destroy.</span>
                    <span class="verse-line indent">I will feed them in justice.</span>
                    <span class="verse-line indent">Behold, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.</span>
                    <span class="verse-line indent">I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David. And he shall feed them and be their shepherd, and I, the Lord, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them.</span>
                    <span class="verse-line indent">I will make with them a covenant of peace, and banish wild beasts from the land, so that they may dwell securely.</span>
                    <span class="verse-line indent">They shall be showers of blessing.</span>
                    <span class="verse-line indent">They shall know that I am the Lord their God with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people.</span>
                    <span class="verse-line indent">Declares the Lord God: you are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, and I am your God.</span>

                <h3>Sermon Thoughts</h3>
                <div class="cr-callout">
                    <p><span class="cr-emphasis">The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.</span> He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. For you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever. <em>— Psalm 23</em></p>
                </div>
                <p>So if you guys have your bulletins, there's a sheet here with supporting passages and room to take notes on the back. Starting with Psalm 23—David wrote this. I'm done. I can go home now. That's it. Psalm 23.</p>
                <blockquote class="cr-pull-quote">Jesus Christ is the good and the true shepherd—he alone cares for us and protects us from the wolves.</blockquote>
                <p>Now there's a few passages I wanted to look at. We've been in this series talking about the kingdom of God, and in these last few Sundays we've been talking about what the Bible teaches us about the shepherds and the sheep—because we're just sheep of his pasture. We're part of the kingdom of God and he is our shepherd. We're not our own shepherd. <span class="cr-emphasis">Jesus Christ himself is our good shepherd.</span> We read John 10:11–18 last Sunday: Jesus Christ is the good and the true shepherd; he alone cares for us and protects us from the wolves when satan comes to steal and kill and destroy. Jesus is our shepherd—even though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we don't have to fear any evil, because he's with us and his rod and his staff comfort me.</p>
                <p>What we read in Luke 15—the parable of the lost sheep—Jesus teaches that the good shepherd will leave the 99 and go after the one. When he finds the one, he picks it up and carries it on his shoulders. Oftentimes he would break one of its legs so it wouldn't wander—he would correct it, because it's straying.</p>
                <blockquote class="cr-pull-quote">My sheep hear my voice, and they follow me.</blockquote>
                <p>You've heard that saying: not all those who wander are lost. Oftentimes those who wander are very lost indeed. Maybe they went on a hike one day and thought, I'll just wander a little bit away from my shepherd—and three, four, five hours go by, they look around, they're lost in the woods. Who's going to find them? Jesus the shepherd—he leaves the 99 and goes after the one, because he's a good shepherd. God is a good Father; he loves his children and cares for us even today.</p>
                <p>First Timothy chapter three teaches that as an overseer, as a shepherd, I first must have my own household in order—otherwise I'm unfit to shepherd the flock of God. So for three years I went to Idaho and raised my kids in the Lord. We had ups and downs—we lived in a camper for a year and a half, travelled around, saw the countryside, eventually moved into a house in Coeur d'Alene. God provided. I chose to get my household in order before being a good shepherd.</p>
                <p>I try my best—I'm not perfect; none of us are. We must trust in Jesus, because he is the good shepherd, the chief shepherd. Someday when Christ returns, he will judge all the shepherds—the good ones he'll find faithful; the false shepherds who've been eating the fat and not caring for the sheep, he'll have something to say. In John 10:19–30 we see the sheep of Christ: when they hear his voice they follow him. <span class="cr-emphasis">My sheep hear my voice and they follow me</span>—Jesus says. Today, if we hear his voice, are we going to obey?</p>
                <p>I need rest—Mondays is my rest day. I'm limited; my flesh is weak. Spurgeon was asked why his ministry was so successful. He said: my people pray for me. That's it. Pray for me. I'm called to shepherd my wife first, then my children, then the rest of the world. If I'm failing as a shepherd of my household, that's God saying: your wife and your kids come first.</p>
                <p>In John 6:35–40 we see the will of God concerning his sheep: Jesus would lose none of them but raise them up on the last day. When people ask why I believe in eternal security, I ask: can Jesus lose one of his sheep? Jesus says he can't. The Bible says it; I believe it. In John 6:41–51 we see the true sheep are drawn by him—God has been calling his sheep since Abraham. When you hear the voice of God, when you trust and put your faith in Jesus and repent—it's irresistible. Nothing can take us out of his hand. Christ alone chooses his sheep: You did not choose me, but I chose you.</p>
                <p>Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners. Noah found favour with God—not because he was good, but because he trusted God and obeyed. His whole family was saved. There was nothing before—nothing produces nothing. There had to have been something: <span class="cr-emphasis">God. Eternal. The triune God—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—existing in perfect unity and harmony throughout all eternity.</span></p>

                        <h2>Shakespearean Rhymed Version</h2>
                        <div class="shakespearean-verse">Hark, good folk, to Ezekiel's word so grave,
Of shepherds false, and sheep both bold and brave;
Fat ones that tread the verdant pastures low,
Lean ones that wander, lost in woe and throe.
Barbara's hymn doth stir the soul's deep fire,
"What friend we have in Jesus," lifts us higher;
Though Christ's return we know not when or how,
He'll ride on white steed, sword from mouth to plow
The nations with God's word, in judgment keen,
Dividing truth, as none but He hath seen.
We strive to teach, yet falter in our art,
But He alone doth rightly guide the heart.

Open thy tomes to Ezekiel's page,
Chapter four-and-thirty, in sacred rage;
Verses one to one-and-thirty tell
Of prophets' wrath where false guides do dwell.
The Lord to man's son speaks: "Prophesy bold
Against the shepherds of Israel's fold,
Who feed themselves, neglect the flock's dire need,
Eat fat, wear wool, slay strong, let weak ones bleed.
No strength for frail, no heal for sick or sore,
No bind for hurt, no seek for lost once more;
With force and harshness rule they o'er the meek,
Scattered the sheep, as wild beasts prey and seek.

O'er mountains high and hills they roam astray,
No hand to search, no voice to lead the way.
Thus saith the Lord: 'As I live, hear My vow,
My flock a prey, devoured by beasts now,
For lack of guide, shepherds self-fed and blind—
I stand against them, claim My sheep in kind.
No more shall they devour, I'll rescue all,
From mouths of greed, My lambs no longer fall.'

Behold, I Myself shall search and pursue,
As shepherd seeks his scattered flock anew;
On cloudy day, in darkness thick and deep,
I'll gather them from lands where they did creep.
From peoples far, from countries wide and vast,
Bring to their soil, feed on Israel's past;
On mountains tall, by ravines cool and green,
In habitations fair, their graze serene.
Good pasture rich, on heights where they shall lie,
In justice feed, no more to fear or cry.

The lost I'll find, the strayed I'll bring aright,
Bind injured limbs, strengthen the weak with might;
But fat and strong, in pride who trample low,
I'll feed in justice, their destruction know.
Betwixt sheep and sheep, rams and goats I judge,
Good pasture trod, clear waters turned to sludge;
My flock eats dregs, drinks muddied streams unclean—
Behold, I judge 'twixt fat sheep and the lean.

With side and shoulder push ye weak aside,
With horns thrust hard, till scattered far and wide;
I'll save My flock, no prey to beasts or foe,
Judge sheep from sheep, in equity bestow.
One shepherd set, My servant David true,
To feed and guide, their prince in morning dew.
I, Lord, their God, with covenant of peace,
Banish wild beasts, let wilderness increase;
Secure they dwell, in woods they sleep unbound,
Showers of blessing fall on hallowed ground.

Trees yield their fruit, earth gives its bounteous yield,
Secure in land, from yokes and chains unsealed;
No more enslaved, no hunger's cruel bite,
No nations' scorn, in safety's pure delight.
They'll know I am the Lord, with them I stand,
House of Israel, My people in My hand;
Ye are My sheep, of pasture green and wide,
I am your God," the Lord God doth confide.

Now pray we all: O Heavenly Father dear,
In Jesus' name, Thy word so true and clear;
Not ours the church, nor kingdom vast and grand,
We're but a part, held in Thy guiding hand.
Help us be faithful, fruitful in Thy sight,
No fat nor lazy sheep in idle night;
No barren trees, but bearing fruit so sweet,
Through strength Thou giv'st, our service made complete.
Abide in Thee, as vine to branch doth cling,
Bear much in Christ, from whom all good doth spring.
Apart from Him, naught can we e'er achieve,
Supply our need, in faith help us believe.

From Psalm the three-and-twentieth, David's song:
"The Lord my Shepherd, I shall want no wrong;
Green pastures lie, still waters lead my way,
Restores my soul, in righteousness I stay.
Though valley's shadow death doth darkly loom,
No evil fear, Thy rod and staff my boon;
Table prepared 'fore foes, oil on my head,
Cup overflows, goodness and mercy spread.
All days of life, Thy house my dwelling sure."

Christ, Good Shepherd, guards from wolf's cruel lure;
Leaves ninety-nine for one lost in the wild,
Carries on shoulders, corrects the errant child.
Not all who wander lost? Nay, lost indeed,
Away from fold, in peril's thorny reed.
He seeks the stray, for love of child divine,
As father good, His care forever thine.

In household first, as Timothy doth teach,
Shepherd thy kin, ere flock thou dar'st to reach;
Three years in Idaho, in camper's hold,
Raised children true, in Lord's own story told.
Ups, downs we knew, yet God provided grace,
Knit us as one in that confined embrace.
Obeyed His call, though plans did shift and veer,
From Spirit Lake to paths anew and clear.

Imperfect all, yet trust in Chief Shepherd's might,
Who judges false, rewards the faithful light.
My sheep hear voice, follow where'er I lead,
Eternal life, no snatch from hand indeed.
Today obey, if called from heaven's throne,
Rest in His will, make Sabbath day thine own.

Though flesh be weak, limited in its span,
Pray for thy shepherd, as Spurgeon's wise plan.
Children with angels, pray for father's need,
In guardian watch, Thy help we humbly plead.
Preach I with joy, though hours be few and fleet,
Family first, then world at Savior's feet.

In John the sixth, God's will for sheep revealed:
Lose none, but raise on last day, grace unsealed.
Eternal secure, for Christ doth hold us fast,
No power can tear from Father's grasp at last.
Drawn by His call, from Abraham's ancient day,
Irresistible grace, in gospel's ray.
Spirit gives life, regenerates the soul,
Chosen by Him, made pure and ever whole.

Came He to save the sinners lost and vile,
Hearts wicked deep, in evil's constant guile;
Yet Noah found favor, by faith and obey,
Family saved, in ark through flood's dismay.
Not evolution's tale, but God's own hand,
Eternal Triune, in unity grand.
From nothing? Nay, Creator's word doth bring
All that we see, in harmony they sing.</div>

                            <p>Would you pray with me? Heavenly Father, when we come before you in Jesus' name and your name, and we thank you God for your word that is true. That's not our word. We thank you for your church. It's not our church. We thank you for your kingdom. We're just a part of it. Lord, help us to be faithful. Help us that you would find us faithful. When you come someday, Lord, would you help us to find us faithful? That you would walk by these sheep here of this church, and that you would not find any fat ones, not any lazy ones, not any trees, not any plants, big trees that are not bearing any fruit, but you would find us faithful that we would be bearing fruit. And Lord, we know that you're going to do it. You're going to provide. You're going to provide. Lord, so help us. We can only do anything at all through the strength that you supply. We can only serve you with the strength that you supply. We can only bear fruit if we abide in you, Jesus. So help us to abide. On 15.5, abide in me and I in you. If you abide in me, you bear much fruit. From apart from me, you can do no thing, not a thing. Lord, help us to abide. Help us to be faithful. Give us the strength, supply the strength that we need to serve you and be faithful. Be with us now as we spend a few moments at the end of our service to talk about your word for a little bit. In Jesus' name, amen.</p>
