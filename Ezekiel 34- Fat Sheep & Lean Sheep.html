        <h1>Ezekiel 34: Fat Sheep & Lean Sheep</h1>
        <p>A Reflection on Good Shepherds, False Shepherds, and the Faithful Flock of God</p>

            <h2>Full Sermon Text</h2>
            <p>Take that song. What a friend we have in Jesus. Amen, Barbara. That last born penny. Great choice. That's one of my favourite ones because we just sang that one a few weeks back and I was talking about it. And you know, we cannot tell when Christ is going to rule the nations, but he's going to do it someday. All flesh is going to see him return. Revelations say on riding a white horse with the sword sticking out of his mouth, which is the word of God to judge the nations. He only in him alone can rightly divide the word of truth and teach it accurately. We try. We sure do.</p>
            <p>And so if you can open up your Bibles as we now open up his word, open up with me to Ezekiel chapter 34, the whole chapter, verses one through 31. And if there's a Bible in front of you, for those maybe who are new, or if you have a Bible, you guys have a Bible over there? Good. Okay. Yep. If you have your Bibles with you, Will, did you bring your Bible? Yeah. Yes, son, you have your Bible? Good. Please open up to Ezekiel chapter 34, verses one through 31. And the title of my sermon this morning is fat, sheep and lean sheep, fat, sheep and lean sheep. Start in verse one, is equal chapter 34. You follow along and read this together. It's a prophecy against the shepherds of Israel.</p>
            <div class="bible-verse">
                <p><strong>Ezekiel 34:1-31</strong><br>
                The word of the Lord came to me, son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy and say to them, even to the shepherds, thus says the Lord God, all shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves, should not shepherds feed the sheep, you eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat ones, but you do not feed the sheep.<br>
                The weak you have not strengthened, the sick you have not healed, the injured you have not bound up, the strayed you have not brought back, the lost you have not sought, and with force and harshness you have ruled them. Verse five. So they were scattered because there was no shepherd and they became food for all the wild beasts.<br>
                My sheep were scattered. They wandered over all the mountains on every high hill. My sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth with none to search or seek for them.<br>
                Verse seven. Therefore you shepherds hear the word of the Lord. As I live, declares the Lord God, surely because my sheep have become a prey and my sheep have become food for all the wild beasts, since there was no shepherd, because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the shepherds have fed themselves and have not fed my sheep.<br>
                Therefore, you shepherds hear the word of the Lord, thus says the Lord God, behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require my sheep at their hand and put a stop to their feeding the sheep. No longer shall the shepherds feed themselves, I will rescue my sheep from their mouths, that they may not be food for them. Verse 11.<br>
                For thus says the Lord God, behold, I myself, I, I myself will search for my sheep, and I will seek them out as a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his sheep that have been scattered. So will I seek out my sheep, and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness. On a day of clouds and thick darkness.<br>
                Verse 13. And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land, and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel by the ravines and all the inhabited places of the country. I will feed them with good pasture, and on the mountain heights of Israel shall be their grazing land.<br>
                There they shall lie down in good grazing land, and on rich pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel. I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I myself will make them lie down and declares the Lord God. I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will destroy.<br>
                I will feed them in justice. In justice. As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord God, behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and male goats.<br>
                Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture, and to drink of clear water, that you must muddy the rest of the water with your feet? And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet, and drink what you have muddied with your feet? Verse 20. Therefore, thus says the Lord God, to them, behold, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. There's that verse.<br>
                Verse 20. Therefore, thus says the Lord God, to them, behold, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep, because you push with side and shoulder, and thrust at all the weak with your horns, till you have scattered them abroad. I will rescue my flock.<br>
                They shall no longer be a prey, and I will judge between sheep and sheep, and I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David. And he shall feed them, and he shall feed them, and be their shepherd, and I, the Lord, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them. I am the Lord I have spoken, the Lord's covenant of peace.<br>
                Bless be verses. I will make with them a covenant of peace, and banish wild beasts from the land, so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. And I will make them, and the places all around my hill, a blessing.<br>
                And I will send down the showers in their season. They shall be showers of blessing, verse 27, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase. And they shall be secure in their land, and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I break the bars of their yoke, and deliver them from the hand of those who enslaved them.<br>
                They shall no more be a prey to the nations, nor shall the beasts of the land devour them. They shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid. And I will provide for them renowned plantations, so that they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land, and no longer suffer the reproach of the nations.<br>
                Bless two verses. And they shall know that I am the Lord their God with them. They shall know that I'm the Lord their God with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people.<br>
                Declares the Lord God, and you are my sheep, human sheep of my pasture, and I am your God. Declares the Lord God.</p>

            <h3>Sermon Thoughts</h3>
            <p>So if you guys have your, in your bulletins, there's a sheet here. It's got some supporting passages and then a room to take notes on the back. If you have a pen or if you have the supporting passages, we're going to take a look at some of these today as a church. And starting with Psalm 23. You guys know that one? Psalm 23. Ever heard of it? Psalm 23. I mean, I could quote it most likely, but let's read it. Out of the ESV version today. Psalm chapter 23 starting in verse one. The Lord is my shepherd. The Psalm of David. David wrote this. The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no eagle. For you are with me and your rod and your staff. They comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup overflows. Surely, not maybe, surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen. I'm done. I can go home now. That's it. That's it. Psalm 23.</p>
            <p>Now there's a few passages I wanted to look at and if you guys have been following along we've been in this kind of this series of talking about the kingdom of God and in these last few Sundays we've been talking about what the Bible teaches us about what the shepherds are and what the sheep are because we're just sheep of his pasture. We're just a part of the kingdom of God and he is our shepherd. We're not we're not our own shepherd. Jesus Christ himself is our good shepherd. We read John 10 11 through 18 last Sunday that Jesus Christ is the good and the true shepherd that he and he alone cares for us and he alone protects us from the wolves when they come and when satan comes to try to steal and kill and destroy us. Jesus Christ himself is our shepherd and even though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we don't have to fear any evil because he's with us and his rod and his staff comfort me. It gives me comfort because I know that when the enemy comes to try to steal kill and destroy me the wolves try to come in. Jesus is there with his staff and he's going to use it to protect me and to lead me and to guide me and to correct me at times. What a shepherd would do what we read in Luke 15 the parable of the lost sheep that in that context of that parable that Jesus teaches that that the good shepherd will leave the 99 and go after the one and when he finds the one what does he do? He picks it up and carries it all over his shoulders and oftentimes he would like break one of its legs so it wouldn't wander ever again just for a little bit stay put he would correct it right because it's wandering it's going to stray.</p>
            <p>You've heard that that saying probably that not all those who wander are lost oftentimes those who wander are very lost very lost indeed they maybe they knew where they were going maybe they you know went on a hike one day and thought I'll just wander just a little bit away from the kingdom a little bit away from my shepherd and then you know three hours four hours five hours goes by and they look around they're lost in the woods they're by themselves who's going to find them who's going to go after him who Jesus the shepherd he leaves the 99 and he goes after the one because he's a good shepherd God is a good father he loves his children and he cares for us even today he does wait a minute I care for you and the kids I love you I lead my wife and my children because you know first Timothy chapter three teaches me that as an overseer as a shepherd that I first must have my own household in order otherwise I'm unfit to shepherd the household the flock of God so I made made sure that for three years I went to Idaho and I raised my kids in the Lord to make sure that my household was in order before I ever took any other position at a church again and I did it with the help of God of course we had some ups and we had some downs didn't we in North Idaho Sherry we lived in the camper for a year and a half we travelled around and we got to see the countryside and we got to eventually move into a house in downtown Port of Lane and Sanders Beach and it was beautiful we could take our kids and walk to the beach it's like every day in the summer kids like we go to the beach again it's like sure we could walk there it's right there and God provided that for me for my family because I was obedient to him and he was faithful to me and provided for me and my family and he knitted us together in such a unique and special way during that season when we were close proximity living in a camper with four kids and pets imagine it for a year and a half all you can do is try to get used to each other and all you can do is either you know love each other or hate each other there's not a lot of space so you know go to your room it's like the back of the camper you know and so it was a fun time you know I wouldn't trade that season for anything but would I do it again probably not knowing what I know now you know but I don't have to do it because that season's gone and I wouldn't have stayed there in Coeur d'Alene God provided a house and you're living downtown you know I wanted to stay there and I thought that I was going to stay there I thought I was going to be a pastor somewhere in Coeur d'Alene in fact I thought that I was going to go plan a church in Spirit Valley and Spirit Lake North Idaho that was my goal I was like wanted to be a shepherd of that place I really did it's still very special dear to my heart but God had a different plan for me and my family and I chose to get my household in order before I was able to be a good shepherd and I try my best I do I'm not perfect none of us are and we all us we must do is trust in Jesus because he is the good shepherd he's the chief shepherd and someday when Christ returns you know all the shepherds everywhere we just read in Ezekiel all the shepherds everywhere he's gonna judge them and divide them in the good shepherd so find faithful and say thank you I'm back now give me my church yeah and for the bad ones uh for those who are fake shepherds or false shepherds who've been uh eating you know eating the fat and who've been um not caring for the sheep he's going to have something to say about that I think because he is the shepherd and he cares for his sheep in a way that no pastor could actually rightly understand Jesus cares for his children they're his children we all this here are the children of God and because of that he cares for us and so in John 10 19 through 30 we see this amazing passage of the sheep of Christ and they they when they hear his voice they follow him when the sheep hear the the voice of their shepherd they follow him they don't run away into the woods and get themselves lost and hurt and dead but they follow him my sheep hear my voice and they follow me Jesus says now today if we hear his voice are we going to obey are we going to follow him today if Jesus calls from heaven son daughter do this or don't do this stop no don't do it we're going to listen we're going to do whatever we want I try I try to listen to Jesus if I feel like he's leading me a certain way or if I feel like he's telling me to do something or to not do something to stop sometimes Jesus says stop and recently he's told me that like for rest he's like you stop like rest Mondays Mondays is your rest day I'm waiting for Monday tomorrow so I can rest so I can maybe shut my phone off for one day and just spend time with my wife and my kids because that is what it means to honour the Sabbath it doesn't have to be Sunday or Saturday for pastors Sunday is my busiest day but I can't not have no rest today but tomorrow I can I even have a meeting after church today I gotta go to another meeting another one that's fine I love to do it but I do need rest because I'm only man I'm I've limited capacity I don't have maximum capacity I don't have like maximum capacity I'm limited my flesh I am weak I can get hurt I can fall and trip and break my leg if it happened tomorrow then what I can lose my voice then what right I would trust Joe you come up here picture good seminar that or Jay right or Glenn or Don or Kurt Dave or Sherwin or whoever Bill right Peter I got everybody Mike but Gabriel maybe will not yet Georgie yeah you guys would help me out I think you know because I'm limited and my body is weak and tired sometimes and sometimes I don't get good rest especially Saturday nights man I'll tell you man the enemy loves to try to come and steal my rest on Saturday night so you don't want to come up here to preach a good sermon I'll tell you that and so you know I recently had a PRC meeting and after you know last Sunday the Sunday previous Sunday before I can't remember what it was the PRC is the pastoral relations committee and what it is is that the people who are at this church who have like a joy or a concern about what they think about me as the shepherd they relay it maybe sometimes to the deacons or to each other they talk amongst themselves and the PRC committee they meet with the pastor pastor relation committee we sit down and they share me with me the joys and the concerns and sometimes it's more heavy on the joy side sometimes it's more heavy on the concern side my lesson right and then when I get a chance to talk at the very end of it what I say is I say this you guys remember what I said well what do you need pastor you got anything what did I say CH Spurgeon had a quote one time somebody asked him why is your ministry so successful what's your secret and all Spurgeon said was this my people pray for me that's it pray for me that's all if I need some help maybe if I ask you I won't tell you I promise try not to but if I need some help you know sometimes I have a hard time asking if you offer some help but but yeah and even with my kids you know I with my with my little ones my three little ones Bennett he's like me 2.0 look at how tall he is dark here dark guys he's like me 2.0 he's my helper he helps me with stuff right don't you buddy uh because he's a young man now so I'm like taking him I'm like shepherding him and discipling him now because he's old enough now he's sitting after his Sunday school adult meetings and uh he's there learning and growing in his faith and in his walk with Jesus and he's up here sometimes reading scripture because he's my son he's gonna be doing that stuff my oldest he's my eldest son uh but my three little ones they're still figuring life out right Everly is going to be seven next month seven eight and nine Everly Jack and Eliana Everly Joy right Jack White and Eliana Grace they are my little just like they just love me and my wife so much they just like love me we're gone for like an hour or two we come home they're just like you've been gone for three weeks it's like oh my gosh you know mom whenever mom goes my wife she cleans houses whenever she goes and cleans the house for like an hour or two she comes back and really is just like running to the door I can't wait to see mom and we cherish that time it's special but they just don't understand a lot about life right now and so I told my kids the other day I taught them a little lesson about guardian angels and I said you know guys uh do you know that the bible teaches us that uh that the angels that watch over the little ones that they're in the presence of god all the time and I said uh what you guys should do is you guys have guardian angels what you guys should do is at nighttime just real quick just pray for your dad yeah maybe maybe I can have some of your angels to help me you know it's even praying for me I asked them I'm like guys what are you going to do tonight before you go to bed pray for you dad because I need it I do I need the help from one person there's only so many hours in a day and and I love it I just preaching sermons for me is my favourite thing to do it really is I could be up here for longer every Sunday and I try to be respectful and I try to close it off and like you done I could be up here all day in fact I like pick up extra preaching jobs I preach for other people for other churches I have a preaching uh appointment scheduled for Thursday in Pakistan with the translator my friend who's a pastor over there I'm going to preach for like an hour he's going to translate because I love to do it I do I do it for free but I have a family right I do and we need a house we need food and groceries and you know paper packs and stuff and we got some guinea pigs recently and that's fun Everly's birthday present three guinea pigs three of them regretted immediately almost uh but no it's fine they whine sometimes and I'm going to take care of them it's usually not with ever and helping you do it but the reason I say all this stuff is that you know I'm called to be a shepherd of my wife first and then my children and then the rest of the world in that order I trust and obey God and I shepherd my wife first then my children then the rest of the world in that order if I feel like I'm failing as a shepherd of my household then that's God trying to tell me whoa whoa whoa whoa your priorities got a lot of lack there because your wife and your kids come first and I try my best to obey that it's tough I do fail at it sometimes imagine that um but I try in John 6 35 through 40 we see that the will of God concerning his sheep is that he would lose none of them actually that the will of God concerning his sheep that he would not lose a single one of them and John 6 35 through 40 these verses I wanted to get to last Sunday but I didn't have time but I chose not to is uh we had we see this amazing passage in John 6 actually all these last next four of them they're all one passage John 6 35 through 40 John 6 41 through 51 John 6 60 through 67 and finally John 6 68 through 70 what it really is is John 6 35 through um 71 just broke it up into little sections to fill the page and it's just the book of John chapter 6 and first few verses 35 through 40 it's the will of God concerning the sheep is that Jesus would lose none of his sheep but raise them up on the last day and this is the will of God concerning the sheep of God that he would lose not even one single one but he would raise faithfully raise each and every one of the sheep up on the last day and sometimes when people ask me why I believe in eternal security why I believe that my salvation is secure that for the people of God and the children of God that we can't lose our salvation once saved always saved I ask them this simple question I say can Jesus lose one of his sheep well Jesus says that he can't in John 6 and so right the Bible says it I believe it that settles ahead for me right Jesus says he's not going to lose one of them so that's why I believe in eternal security that's that I mean there's other passages too Romans 9, Ephesians 1, and John 10 but that's his will he's not going to lose any of them and then John 6 41 through 51 we see that the true sheep of God are drawn by him so God right now in all of his creations since the dawn of human history has been calling his sheep even as far back as Abraham he called Abraham he called Abraham and he said Abraham go to the place that I'm going to show you you're not going to know yet but I'm going to tell you but trust me no baby and he called Abraham right God called Abraham he calls his sheep he calls out the voice of God goes out into all of his creation so that he could draw his sheep to him and when the when the sheep hear the voice of their good shepherd they will come not maybe it's irresistible grace when you hear the voice of God when you understand the gospel of your salvation when you trust and put your faith in Jesus and repent and turn from your ways your wicked ways and turn to Jesus it's irresistible it's just the best thing in the planet is a relationship with Jesus Christ it's what we're made for it's what our souls are made for it's what we need and desire most is him not the world not the things of the world and in John 6 60 through 67 we know that the Spirit of Christ gives eternal life that he saves us he he draws us he calls us he draws us he saves us he gives us eternal life and nothing can take us out of his hand John 10 nothing can take us out of the Father's hand Jesus Christ and the Father I want and nothing in this world not even my own free will that I think that I have can take me out of the hand of God nothing can actually not Satan not not the devils the demons not presidents or rulers not sin and temptation not um cranky parents or cranky wives and arguments and not my children they were wearing me out nothing can take me out of God's hand and I will never lose my salvation but it's the will of God that he will raise me up on the last day and he's faithful he will surely do it that's why I always finish these days with first Thessalonians 5 23 and 24 now may the God have peace himself sanctify you completely may your whole soul body and spirit be kept blameless at the day of our Lord Jesus Christ he who calls you draws you is faithful he will maybe do it surely do it he's faithful he will surely do it and he is doing it right now his voice is going out into all this creation and people are hearing the voice of God and the sheep that are his are hearing it and turning from their sin and repenting and putting their faith in Jesus God regenerates them and they will never be lost again Christ alone chooses his sheep John 6 68 through 71 you did not choose me but I chose you Jesus says he chose his disciples he chose his apostles he chose all his disciples he came to the woman at the well on John chapter 4 read her mail told her everything about her life and she then believed in him and he went back to her town Samaria the Samaritan woman she went back to her town and told this of this man that she met that that knew everything about her life I never met someone like this before he must be maybe see the messiah 1st Timothy 1 12 through 17 we know that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners he did he came into the world to save us people right good healthy people don't need a physician it's the sick ones do the sinners we need God desperately the human heart is deceitfully wicked above all else who can know it who can understand it God looked down from heaven in Genesis chapter 6 and he looked at the hearts of man and he said in Genesis 6 he looked at humanity and he saw in their hearts he saw that every single intention of the thoughts of the heart of man was only evil continually but Noah found favour with God it doesn't mean that Noah's heart wasn't also deceitfully wicked it was but Noah found favour with God why because he was a good person no because he trusted God and he obeyed that's it he put his faith in God and he obeyed and Noah found favour with God so what happened his whole family was saved his whole family was saved that's covenantal theology right there by the way his whole family was saved and the animals too a bunch of animals and birds and fishes and they teach at the universities these days that that didn't happen that's a fake story creationism that it didn't happen that way that Noah's ark is just a cement just a good story never actually happened right because evolution of course there wasn't a bunch of animals that long ago that that God created and they were always that way but they evolved over the course of millions of years time and chance acting on matter it's ridiculous right believing that everything that we see came into being somehow like you know somehow it came into being but here's the thing like there was nothing before and nothing produces nothing so there has to have been something before all of this stuff that we see there had to have been something what was it it was God he's eternal the triune God the Father Son and the Holy Spirit existing in perfect unity and harmony throughout all eternity.</p>

            <h2>Shakespearean Rhymed Version</h2>
            <div class="shakespearean-verse">
Hark, good folk, to Ezekiel’s word so grave,
Of shepherds false, and sheep both bold and brave;
Fat ones that tread the verdant pastures low,
Lean ones that wander, lost in woe and throe.
Barbara’s hymn doth stir the soul’s deep fire,
“What friend we have in Jesus,” lifts us higher;
Though Christ’s return we know not when or how,
He’ll ride on white steed, sword from mouth to plow
The nations with God’s word, in judgment keen,
Dividing truth, as none but He hath seen.
We strive to teach, yet falter in our art,
But He alone doth rightly guide the heart.

Open thy tomes to Ezekiel’s page,
Chapter four-and-thirty, in sacred rage;
Verses one to one-and-thirty tell
Of prophets’ wrath where false guides do dwell.
The Lord to man’s son speaks: “Prophesy bold
Against the shepherds of Israel’s fold,
Who feed themselves, neglect the flock’s dire need,
Eat fat, wear wool, slay strong, let weak ones bleed.
No strength for frail, no heal for sick or sore,
No bind for hurt, no seek for lost once more;
With force and harshness rule they o’er the meek,
Scattered the sheep, as wild beasts prey and seek.

O’er mountains high and hills they roam astray,
No hand to search, no voice to lead the way.
Thus saith the Lord: ‘As I live, hear My vow,
My flock a prey, devoured by beasts now,
For lack of guide, shepherds self-fed and blind—
I stand against them, claim My sheep in kind.
No more shall they devour, I’ll rescue all,
From mouths of greed, My lambs no longer fall.’

Behold, I Myself shall search and pursue,
As shepherd seeks his scattered flock anew;
On cloudy day, in darkness thick and deep,
I’ll gather them from lands where they did creep.
From peoples far, from countries wide and vast,
Bring to their soil, feed on Israel’s past;
On mountains tall, by ravines cool and green,
In habitations fair, their graze serene.
Good pasture rich, on heights where they shall lie,
In justice feed, no more to fear or cry.

The lost I’ll find, the strayed I’ll bring aright,
Bind injured limbs, strengthen the weak with might;
But fat and strong, in pride who trample low,
I’ll feed in justice, their destruction know.
Betwixt sheep and sheep, rams and goats I judge,
Good pasture trod, clear waters turned to sludge;
My flock eats dregs, drinks muddied streams unclean—
Behold, I judge ‘twixt fat sheep and the lean.

With side and shoulder push ye weak aside,
With horns thrust hard, till scattered far and wide;
I’ll save My flock, no prey to beasts or foe,
Judge sheep from sheep, in equity bestow.
One shepherd set, My servant David true,
To feed and guide, their prince in morning dew.
I, Lord, their God, with covenant of peace,
Banish wild beasts, let wilderness increase;
Secure they dwell, in woods they sleep unbound,
Showers of blessing fall on hallowed ground.

Trees yield their fruit, earth gives its bounteous yield,
Secure in land, from yokes and chains unsealed;
No more enslaved, no hunger’s cruel bite,
No nations’ scorn, in safety’s pure delight.
They’ll know I am the Lord, with them I stand,
House of Israel, My people in My hand;
Ye are My sheep, of pasture green and wide,
I am your God,” the Lord God doth confide.

Now pray we all: O Heavenly Father dear,
In Jesus’ name, Thy word so true and clear;
Not ours the church, nor kingdom vast and grand,
We’re but a part, held in Thy guiding hand.
Help us be faithful, fruitful in Thy sight,
No fat nor lazy sheep in idle night;
No barren trees, but bearing fruit so sweet,
Through strength Thou giv’st, our service made complete.
Abide in Thee, as vine to branch doth cling,
Bear much in Christ, from whom all good doth spring.
Apart from Him, naught can we e’er achieve,
Supply our need, in faith help us believe.

From Psalm the three-and-twentieth, David’s song:
“The Lord my Shepherd, I shall want no wrong;
Green pastures lie, still waters lead my way,
Restores my soul, in righteousness I stay.
Though valley’s shadow death doth darkly loom,
No evil fear, Thy rod and staff my boon;
Table prepared ‘fore foes, oil on my head,
Cup overflows, goodness and mercy spread.
All days of life, Thy house my dwelling sure.”

Christ, Good Shepherd, guards from wolf’s cruel lure;
Leaves ninety-nine for one lost in the wild,
Carries on shoulders, corrects the errant child.
Not all who wander lost? Nay, lost indeed,
Away from fold, in peril’s thorny reed.
He seeks the stray, for love of child divine,
As father good, His care forever thine.

In household first, as Timothy doth teach,
Shepherd thy kin, ere flock thou dar’st to reach;
Three years in Idaho, in camper’s hold,
Raised children true, in Lord’s own story told.
Ups, downs we knew, yet God provided grace,
Knit us as one in that confined embrace.
Obeyed His call, though plans did shift and veer,
From Spirit Lake to paths anew and clear.

Imperfect all, yet trust in Chief Shepherd’s might,
Who judges false, rewards the faithful light.
My sheep hear voice, follow where’er I lead,
Eternal life, no snatch from hand indeed.
Today obey, if called from heaven’s throne,
Rest in His will, make Sabbath day thine own.

Though flesh be weak, limited in its span,
Pray for thy shepherd, as Spurgeon’s wise plan.
Children with angels, pray for father’s need,
In guardian watch, Thy help we humbly plead.
Preach I with joy, though hours be few and fleet,
Family first, then world at Savior’s feet.

In John the sixth, God’s will for sheep revealed:
Lose none, but raise on last day, grace unsealed.
Eternal secure, for Christ doth hold us fast,
No power can tear from Father’s grasp at last.
Drawn by His call, from Abraham’s ancient day,
Irresistible grace, in gospel’s ray.
Spirit gives life, regenerates the soul,
Chosen by Him, made pure and ever whole.

Came He to save the sinners lost and vile,
Hearts wicked deep, in evil’s constant guile;
Yet Noah found favor, by faith and obey,
Family saved, in ark through flood’s dismay.
Not evolution’s tale, but God’s own hand,
Eternal Triune, in unity grand.
From nothing? Nay, Creator’s word doth bring
All that we see, in harmony they sing.

            <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
            <div class="bible-verse">
                <p>Would you pray with me? Heavenly Father, when we come before you in Jesus' name and your name, and we thank you God for your word that is true. That's not our word. We thank you for your church. It's not our church. We thank you for your kingdom. We're just a part of it. Lord, help us to be faithful. Help us that you would find us faithful. When you come someday, Lord, would you help us to find us faithful? That you would walk by these sheep here of this church, and that you would not find any fat ones, not any lazy ones, not any trees, not any plants, big trees that are not bearing any fruit, but you would find us faithful that we would be bearing fruit. And Lord, we know that you're going to do it. You're going to provide. You're going to provide. Lord, so help us. We can only do anything at all through the strength that you supply. We can only serve you with the strength that you supply. We can only bear fruit if we abide in you, Jesus. So help us to abide. On 15.5, abide in me and I in you. If you abide in me, you bear much fruit. From apart from me, you can do no thing, not a thing. Lord, help us to abide. Help us to be faithful. Give us the strength, supply the strength that we need to serve you and be faithful. Be with us now as we spend a few moments at the end of our service to talk about your word for a little bit. In Jesus' name, amen.</p>
