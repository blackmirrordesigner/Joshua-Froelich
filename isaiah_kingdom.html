            <h2>Full Sermon Text</h2>
            <p>This is 1 through 22, and we're going to read this together. We'll see there's no supporting passages today in your bulletin because I didn't have a whole lot I thought of studying this, and also it's just been a very busy week for us. We had people over last night as I said, and today it's my grandpa's memorial. I just am gonna we're gonna read this passage together, and I have a few thoughts I wanted to share in regards to God's Word and in regards to some of the songs we sang this morning about the kingdom of God.</p>

            <p>The title of my sermon is the coming of Christ's kingdom. If you look in Isaiah chapter 2, we get this account of the mountain of the Lord and the day of the Lord.</p>

            <div class="bible-verse">
                <p><strong>Isaiah 2:1-22</strong><br>
                The word that Isaiah the son of Amos saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:<br>
                It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established as the highest of the mountains and shall be lifted up above the hills, and all the nations shall flow to it.<br>
                And many people shall come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths.”<br>
                For out of Zion shall go the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.<br>
                He shall judge between the nations, and shall decide disputes for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nations shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.<br>
                O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the Lord!<br>
                For you have rejected your people, the house of Jacob, because they are full of things from the east and of fortune tellers like the Philistines, and they strike hands with the children of foreigners.<br>
                Their land is filled with silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures; their land is filled with horses, and there is no end to their chariots.<br>
                Their land is filled with idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their own fingers have made.<br>
                So man is humbled, and each one is brought low; do not forgive them.<br>
                Enter into the rock, and hide in the dust from before the terror of the Lord and from the splendor of his majesty.<br>
                The haughty looks of man shall be brought low, the lofty pride of men shall be humbled; the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.<br>
                For the Lord of hosts has a day against all that is proud and lofty, against all that is lifted up—and it shall be brought low—<br>
                against the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up, and against all the oaks of Bashan,<br>
                against all the lofty mountains, and against all the uplifted hills,<br>
                against every high tower, and against every fortified wall,<br>
                against all the ships of Tarshish, and against all the beautiful craft.<br>
                And the haughtiness of man shall be humbled, and the lofty pride of men shall be brought low; the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.<br>
                And the idols shall utterly pass away.<br>
                And people shall enter the caves of the rocks and the holes of the ground, from before the terror of the Lord and from the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.<br>
                In that day mankind will cast away their idols of silver and their idols of gold, which they have made for themselves to worship, to the moles and to the bats,<br>
                to enter the caverns of the rocks and the clefts of the cliffs, from before the terror of the Lord and from the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.<br>
                Stop regarding man, whose breath is in his nostrils, for of what account is he?</p>

            <h3>Sermon Thoughts</h3>
            <p>Heavenly Father, we come before you in Jesus' name. We thank you God for your word that is truth. God we ask that you would help us to see, to understand, that we would get it—even this morning—that certain things would come together in our minds and in our hearts. We would see you Jesus as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, that we would understand God that you were the righteous judge of all eternity over all of your creation, that there is a day fixed in time when you are coming back to receive the nations as your inheritance.</p>

            <p>God, I pray that you would find this church faithful. I pray that you'd find us your people faithful in that day, that when the terror of the Lord—the terror of the King of Kings comes bringing recompense to judge the nations with the sword sticking out of his mouth like we read in Revelation, which is your word. God is your law, your righteous standard. Only you God know what is morally good and true and righteous, and only you God are the very standard of all goodness. So God help us to know and understand, and help us to testify to your goodness and grace. We ask that you would be with us now in service in Jesus' name.</p>

            <p>This morning, I wanted to share a few thoughts as I was reading through Isaiah 2 this week—reading through this tremendous passage of Scripture. In this chapter, we see very clearly that there is one judge of all creation in his name's God Yahweh, the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, and Jesus Christ himself is the exact imprint of the nature of God. He was born, came in human flesh, took on human flesh—yet he is still God, eternal with the Father, preeminent and transcendent above all creation and before all creation.</p>

            <p>This God, this judge of all peoples, will come back someday and bring with him judgment and glory. If we are in Christ—as we read in Ephesians chapter 1 this morning—if we are in him, predestined before the foundation of the world, if we've been in Christ, the promise is that we've been sealed by the Holy Spirit which is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire full possession of it, for the praise of his glory.</p>

            <p>Many times in this chapter, we see certain phrases stick out to us about the pride of men, the arrogance of men, and how men like to exalt themselves up, and how men like to put themselves up above God. We see many times in Scripture that God humbles men when they do that—like King Nebuchadnezzar. King Nebuchadnezzar is walking on the rooftop of his house, looking out over all of his land, saying "look at my kingdom. Look how great of a man I am." Before he finished talking, God struck him in judgment and humbled him, brought him so low that he crawled around like a beast for seven years, lost his faculties, lost his wisdom, lost his ability to reason.</p>

            <p>We must remember that there is one true king, one true boss, one God, one ruler of all—Jesus Christ our King. We just got done celebrating Christmas, and this is the whole reason for the season: there is one God who came 2,000 years ago in the form not of a conquering king but a suffering servant, the humble Messiah. He came and established his kingdom on earth. Jesus said, "If I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. And he said, 'If you're not for me, you're against me.'" Neutrality is a myth—you are either of the kingdom of God or the kingdom of darkness.</p>

            <p>Our call, as we wait for the king to return, is to strip ourselves of pride and arrogance. We must humble ourselves before the mighty right hand of God, bow our knee to the king. Our allegiance is to the king of kings—we are citizens of heaven first, citizens of America second.</p>

            <p>Justice delayed is not necessarily justice denied. What if a man lives his whole life raping, trafficking, and murdering, then gets caught at 85? Earthly justice may come late, but when he meets his maker, he will give an account for everything he's done. Jesus will judge him, and so will he judge all of us.</p>

            <p>My prayer is that God would find us faithful. That we would wake up every morning not grabbing our cell phones to check social media, not sighing for another day of work or pain, but running with endurance in the race that lies before us, choosing Jesus—the true Sun.</p>

            <h2>Shakespearean Rhymed Version</h2>
            <div class="shakespearean-verse">
Now hark, good folk, to Isaiah’s word,
Of Judah’s hope, of Christ’s own Lord;
A sermon we shall here unfold,
Of that great day when truth shall hold.

No texts to back us in this hour,
For busy days have held their power;
A grandpa’s wake doth weigh the heart,
Yet God’s own truth shall not depart.

Open your Bibles, or your screens,
To Isaiah two, where hope is seen;
The mountain of the Lord shall rise,
Above all hills, to touch the skies.

Nations shall flow to Zion’s gate,
To learn His ways, to walk straight;
Law shall go forth from Jerusalem,
Disputes shall cease, and wars be done.

Swords to plowshares, spears to hooks,
No more shall nations’ fury look;
For Jacob’s house shall walk in light,
Rejecting those who turn from right.

They bow to idols of their hand,
Their gold and silver fill the land;
Pride lifts their heads, but God shall bring
Low haughty hearts, and make them sing
Of His great name, exalted high,
When terror comes from heaven’s sky.

Men shall hide in rocks and dust,
From God’s own wrath, they cannot trust;
Idols of silver, gold, shall fall,
To moles and bats, they’ll give their all.

Oh, let us turn from pride’s sharp sting,
To Christ, our King, our heavenly thing;
He came in flesh, yet God remains,
Eternal, holy, free from stains.

Nebuchadnezzar’s pride was brought low,
When he exalted his own show;
God humbled him to beastly state,
Till he did bow, and learn his fate.

Covenants God hath made of old,
With Adam, Noah, Abraham bold;
Though men break faith, God stays true,
His promises shall never rue.

Christ came as servant, not as king,
To save us all from sin’s sharp sting;
He said, “Ye are for me or against,
No middle ground, no neutral tent.”

So strip your pride, bow down to Him,
Be faithful till He comes again;
For justice delayed is not denied,
When Christ shall judge, and truth abide.

Heavenly Father, hear our prayer,
Renew our strength, our faith repair;
Find us faithful when Thou dost come,
In Jesus’ name, Thy will be done.
            </div>

            <h2>Closing Prayer</h2>
            <p>Heavenly Father, we come before you in Jesus name. We thank you for your word that is truth, and even though we had no supporting passages today, and even though it's been a very long and busy week for us, and even though God some of us here might be needing strength or peace or patience or hope or faith—whatever it is, healing, restoration for families, relationships, friendships with co-workers, with our husbands, our wives, our children, our grandkids—Lord, you can do it and you will do it. You're faithful even when we're faithless, because you are a covenant keeping God.</p>

            <p>So God help us not to break our covenant with you. Oh Lord, help us to be faithful that when you return, you would find us faithful. We ask that you'd find this little church here in Stratford faithful. We ask in Jesus' name, my Lord. Amen.</p>
