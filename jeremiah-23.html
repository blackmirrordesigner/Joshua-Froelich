                <p>American ideologies and our politics over here—there's other countries and other world leaders and other kings and rulers. There's other Christians out there, for instance in Africa, who are getting killed for their faith, persecuted hard. As we follow Christ, that passage I read in Matthew 10:16–20 this morning—<span class="cr-emphasis">the persecutions will come</span>. If we're going to follow Jesus, then persecutions will come. We should not be surprised. We've been promised tribulation and trials in this life.</p>
                <p>We've been pretty secure and safe here in America for the most part. We haven't really experienced a whole lot of suffering—but that does not mean they cannot come. They might come in different forms. Sometimes we as Americans get judged by God in the form of who he decides to have as leader of this country. That's the judgement of God. We see in the Old and New Testament how God raises up kings and leaders—sometimes righteous, sometimes wicked, like Pharaoh in Exodus and Romans 9.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The burden of the Lord is upon false prophets who speak lies in His name, leading people astray with vain hopes and dreams of their own hearts. But God promises a righteous Branch from David—The Lord Our Righteousness—who will gather the remnant, set true shepherds, and bring justice. Jesus declares in John 10: <span class="cr-emphasis">"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep... My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand."</span></p>

                <p>We are not saved by works, but by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8–10). Yet we are called to good works, to love one another, to rightly handle the word of truth, and to represent our King faithfully. False shepherds flee at danger; the true Shepherd protects, provides, and sacrifices Himself. Will He find us faithful when He returns?</p>
                <p>From John 10: Jesus is the Door, the Good Shepherd who knows His own, calls them by name, leads them to abundant life, and ensures no one can snatch them from the Father's hand. He and the Father are one.</p>

                        <h2>Shakespearean Rhymed Version</h2>
                        <div class="shakespearean-verse">Hark! Woe unto the shepherds false and fell,
Who scatter wide the sheep of mine own dell,
Declares the Lord in thunderous righteous ire,
My flock destroyed, driven to peril dire.
Ye care not, nor attend with tender hand,
Behold, I come to judge your evil band!

Yet mercy stirs: the remnant I shall glean
From every land where exile's shadows lean;
Back to their fold, fruitful they shall increase,
No fear, no lack, no missing sheep of peace.
True shepherds rise, appointed by My will,
To guard and guide—none lost, none stray, none ill.

Behold the days approach, the promise bright:
A righteous Branch from David's line in sight!
He reigns as King with wisdom pure and just,
Executes righteousness in every dust.
Judah saved, Israel dwells secure and free—
His name proclaimed: "The Lord Our Righteousness" be!

No more shall Egypt's tale the people sing,
But He who led from north and every spring,
From lands of scattering, back to their own sod—
The Lord who gathers, mighty, true, and God.

Alas! My heart doth break, my bones do quake,
As drunken man o'ercome by wine's fierce wake;
For prophets lie, priests join in wicked way,
Adultery fills the land, the curse holds sway.
Their course is evil, might is turned to wrong,
In Mine own house their filth doth loud prolong.

Like slippery paths in darkness they shall fall,
Disaster waits in year of vengeance call.
Samaria's seers by Baal did lead astray,
But Jerusalem—O horror!—worse display:
Adultery, lies, they strengthen evil's hand,
None turns from sin; like Sodom, Gomorrah stand.

Thus saith the Lord of Hosts: Hear not their voice!
Vain hopes they peddle, visions of their choice;
Not from My mouth, but minds perverse and vain,
To despisers: "Peace!" To rebels: "No pain!"

Who stood in counsel mine, who heard My word?
Who speaks My truth, not dreams absurd?
A tempest whirls, the storm of wrath descends,
Upon the wicked head till purpose ends.

I sent them not, yet ran they swift to cry;
I spake not, yet they prophesied on high.
Had they but stood in council true and deep,
My words they'd speak, and turn My folk from sleep.

Am I a God near only, not afar?
Doth heaven and earth not fill My sight, My star?
I've heard their lies—"I dreamed! I dreamed!" they boast,
Deceit within their hearts, My name they roast.

Let dreamers dream, but he who hath My word
Speak faithfully, let truth be undeterred.
What hath straw with wheat? My word is fire ablaze,
A hammer strong that rock in pieces raze!

Against them stand I—thieves who steal My speech,
Tongues that twist, dreams that falsehood teach.
They lead astray with reckless, lying art,
Unsent by Me, no profit to My heart.

"What is the burden of the Lord?" they cry—
Thou art the burden! Cast thee off, say I.
No more that phrase pervert My living word,
Or punishment upon thy house is stirred.

Everlasting reproach, perpetual shame,
Upon thee falls, forgotten ne'er by name.

Yet hear the Shepherd true in later days:
"I am the Door, the Good One, sheep to raise.
Thieves came before, but Mine hearkened not;
I call by name, lead forth to pasture sought.
Abundant life I give, the thief but slays;
I lay My life—none takes, I freely raise.

The hired hand flees when wolf doth near appear,
Cares not for sheep, leaves all to doubt and fear.
But I know Mine, and Mine know Me full well,
As Father knows Me—love no tongue can tell.
One flock, one Shepherd, gathered from afar,
Eternal life, no snatch from Father's bar.

My sheep My voice do hear, and follow true;
Never perish they, secure in grace anew.
I and the Father One—believe the sign!
My works bear witness: healing, life divine."

O King of righteousness, our hope, our peace,
Thy burden true: that men from lies release.
Teach us, O Lord, to speak Thy word aright,
Faithful and bold, in day and in the night.</div>

We thank you, God, that your word is powerful, like a sledgehammer. Your word is like a consuming fire. Your word is the sword of the Spirit that cuts right to the soul, right to the between joint and marrow of our hearts, of our minds, of our souls, God. We thank you that we can come to you, the living God. We can come to Mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem, the city of the living God, even right now in this place. And we can say thank you for allowing us to be in your kingdom and thank you, God, for teaching us your truth concerning your word and would you, God, teach us what your burden is. There's a burden of the Lord. And Lord, what is that? And help us to understand rightly your word this morning, in Jesus' name, amen.</p>
